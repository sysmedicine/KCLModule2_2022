This tutorial is to prepare the suitable environment for performing basic transcriptomics analysis. Transcriptome data is a rich source to depict gene expressions of a single organism, sampled from single cells, tissues or organs. 

Main objective of transcriptome data based gene expression and further analysis is determining comparable transcriptional differences between donors dependent on a factor, e.g. disease, gender or age, while keeping effect of other factors at minimum. These transcriptional changes help us to understand ____


```{r}
# Packages for Installation
pkgs_needed = c("devtools", "BiocManager")
# Packages for Data Access
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "readxl", "xlsx", "readr", "biomaRt")
# Packages for Feature Extraction Plots
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "umap", "Rtsne")
# Packages for Visually Appealing ggplot
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "ggplot2", "ggplotify")
# Packages for Alternative Graphics
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "pheatmap", "RColorBrewer")
# Packages for Data Manipulation
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "data.table", "dplyr", "tibble")
# Packages for Differential Expression Analysis
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "tximport", "DESeq2")
# Packages for Gene Set Enrichment
pkgs_needed = c(pkgs_needed, "fgsea", "AnnotationDbi", "org.Hs.eg.db", "EnrichmentBrowser")
```

Let's what we are dealing now
```{r}
message('Packages installed already')
head(pkgs_installed)
message('Packages we want to install/load for this session')
head(pkgs_needed)
```


Let's load installed packages necessary for the session. "character.only = T" to pass variable into library function
```{r message=FALSE}
pkgs_installed = rownames(installed.packages())
for(pkgs in intersect(pkgs_needed, pkgs_installed)){library(pkgs, character.only = T)}
```


Let's check not installed packages and install them
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pkgs_installed.2 = rownames(installed.packages())
pkgs_needed.2 <- setdiff(pkgs_needed, pkgs_installed.2)
pkgs_needed.2
for(pkgs in pkgs_needed.2){install.packages(pkgs)}
```

Let's repeat this for packages installed by BiocManager
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pkgs_installed.3 = rownames(installed.packages())
pkgs_needed.3 <- setdiff(pkgs_needed, pkgs_installed.3)
pkgs_needed.3
for(pkgs in pkgs_needed.3){BiocManager::install(pkgs)}
```

Let's check if there is any packages left for installation
```{r}
pkgs_installed.4 = rownames(installed.packages())
pkgs_needed.4 <- setdiff(pkgs_needed, pkgs_installed.4)
pkgs_needed.4
```
